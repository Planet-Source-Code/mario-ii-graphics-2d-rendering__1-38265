## Graphics \- 2D Rendering


</div>

### Description

UPDATED!! m2DRender.bas - Heavily commented! This module contains several functions for the drawing of graphics using BitBlt. It loads images into or out of memory, keeping track of their dimensions and placement inside a device context, with proper resizing to conserve memory. To render an image from memory, all you need to do is provide the index of the image (the order the image was loaded in). It is capable of rendering images with pre-created masks (pre-created inside the module) or drawing images with masks on the fly and rendering stretched images. It also has functions for changing the current display settings. It is suitable for 2D games or just to add animations to windows-based programs. As of now, images with pre-created masks must have a white background to mask properly. This does not apply to the functions that use on-the-fly mask creation. I worked hard on this module, comments are welcome!
